Movie Recommender System
This repository contains a Movie Recommender System project implemented using Python. The project includes a machine learning-based recommendation model and a Streamlit interface to provide user-friendly interaction.

Features
Recommends movies based on user input or similarity to a given movie.
Interactive Streamlit web app for easy access.
Built with machine learning for accurate recommendations.


Repository Structure
bash
Copy code
├── movie-recommender.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation
├── app.py                   # Streamlit app for the recommender interface
├── similarity.pkl           # Pre-trained similarity model (not uploaded due to file size)
└── requirements.txt         # Required Python packages


Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Streamlit App
To launch the web interface:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) to interact with the app.

Notebook
You can explore the model development process by opening the movie-recommender.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook movie-recommender.ipynb
Notes
similarity.pkl: The trained similarity model file is required to run the app. Since it's too large to upload to GitHub, you can download or generate it locally. Make sure to place it in the root directory of this repository.
To regenerate the similarity.pkl file, refer to the notebook for training instructions.
Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit for the web interface
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for building the recommendation model
Future Improvements
Deploy the Streamlit app online for broader accessibility.
Integrate additional datasets to improve recommendation quality.
Optimize the similarity model for faster recommendations.
